#+title: Documentation of DRAWER
#+author: Johannes Keller

* Intention
DRAWER is a common lisp system. It is a wild collection of
abstractions to generate drawings with TIKZ (LaTeX code), Cairo or
SVG. The drawings are described and calculated in some sort of domain
specific language. The goal is that drawings can be exported with all
three backends.

The Cairo and SVG backends are currently incomplete.

I use DRAWER to generate all kinds of diagrams and drawings for
various publications or to study certain contexts. Most of it is
related to musical tunings. I used DRAWER heavily to generate figures
in my PhD thesis. But I also used it in various other scholarly
publications and for research.

* Use
There are not public functions in the package, the user is meant to
work withing the :DRAWER package. A drawing is usually just an
S-expression containing the description of the drawings and some
commands to render it. Evaluating this expression would call the
generation of export files.

* Maintenance
This is a personal project. I keep all drawings I ever generated in
this repository, for future reference. Whenever I need an additional
feature, I implement it for that specific drawing. I'm careful to keep
everything backwards compatible, so that all drawings can be rendered
with any state of the backend code.
